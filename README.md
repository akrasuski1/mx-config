# MX config
My personal config files for MX Linux. Just run `./runall.sh` and you should be fine. Feel free to use it and
if needed, modify to your needs. Features:

- removes ClipIt
- installs full version of vim along with simple vimrc
- changes appearance to Arc-Dark with Cruxish borders and buttons on left side
- sets up a few keyboard shortcuts, mostly related to window manager
- changes a few default settings in xfce-terminal and Thunar
- installs Chromium and sets it as default browser
- installs light-locker as lock screen.

Bonus: there's `xfconf-query-listener.sh` script, that will listen for any changes in xfce config files.
Was quite useful for checking out what to put into scripts.
